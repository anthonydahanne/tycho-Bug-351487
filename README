- What?
Those sample projects are here to demonstrate https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351487 .

- What do those projects do ?
A product (com.compuware.touchpoint.product) containing a plugin (com.compuware.touchpoint.consumer) is being built with Tycho.
The plugin (com.compuware.touchpoint.consumer) must execute a custom touchpoint action when being installed inside a product (https://github.com/anthonydahanne/tycho-Bug-351487/blob/master/com.compuware.touchpoint.consumer/META-INF/p2.inf)
In the real life, this custom touchpoint action could be a migration step, a configuration step, etc...

- How ?
Clone the repo && mvn clean install

- What will I see ?
a failed build, since the touchpoint action is not known by tycho-p2-runtime and, as of today, tycho-p2-runtime is not updatable (not using simpleconfigurator to define its plugins and their start levels, not using a p2 profile to maintain its state)

- What I should see instead ?
a successful build and the tycho-p2-runtime in $M2_REPO/org/eclipse/tycho/tycho-p2-runtime/0.13.0/eclipse updated with com.compuware.touchpoint_1.0.0.qualifier.jar located in its plugins directory + added in the bundles.info

- Solutions so far ?
